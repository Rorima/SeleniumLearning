# README

I'm learning Selenium with Java through a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp. [Here's the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQliGCtqD2w).

Some of the files in this project pertain to the tutorial I'm studying, but most of the files are from my own researches and practices.

All the files from my personal studies are located at `src/java/com/basicstudy`.
